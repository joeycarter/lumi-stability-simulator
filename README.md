# Luminosity Stability Simulator

Run toy experiments to simulate the "luminosity stability" problem. Any
luminosity algorithm may in principle drift over time with respect to the "true"
luminosity, in addition to having its own run-to-run statistical fluctuations.
This script simulates these luminosity algorithms under a variety of scenarios
to study how best to extract a stability uncertainty.
